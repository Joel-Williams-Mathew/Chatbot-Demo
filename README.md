<h1 align="center">Chatbot-Demo</h1>

<h3 align="left">Hey all!
This is a simple chatbot that i have implemented with python and json file. The JSON file is a simple file that stores the data in a set of dictionary data type where the key is the question and the value is its answer. Its not a chatbot that u think like chatgpt,llama and all... Its basically a simple chatbot where the questions and answers are feeded into it by the user which gets saved in a json file which could be retrived at anytime no matter where. The only thing for the revision of data is to make sure that the json file is already downloaded to ur pc thats it..</h3>

<h3 align="left">Hope this will be a nice starting for all of u and me..</h3>
